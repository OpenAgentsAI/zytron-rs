## **Example Usage**

### **Defining and Running Agents**
```rust
use zytron_rs::agent::{Agent, TaskManager};  

fn main() {  
    // Define agents  
    let agent_a = Agent::new("DataCollector", "Collect Market Data");  
    let agent_b = Agent::new("Analyzer", "Analyze Trends");  

    // Orchestrate tasks  
    let mut task_manager = TaskManager::new(vec![agent_a, agent_b]);  
    task_manager.run("Generate DeFi Market Insights");  
}
```

### **Blockchain Integration**
```rust
use zytron_rs::blockchain::{EthereumClient, BlockchainAgent};  

fn main() {  
    // Initialize Ethereum client  
    let eth_client = EthereumClient::new("https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_API_KEY");  

    // Create blockchain-enabled agent  
    let agent = BlockchainAgent::new("DeFiAgent", eth_client);  
    agent.execute_task("Perform asset swap on Ethereum Mainnet");  
}
```
